# Implementation Plan

### Objective

I am building a website for my new client, Andrea & Associates https://www.andreateam.net/

Andrea & Associates provides holistic mental health and therapy services through a collaborative therapy collective offering individualized counseling, group therapy, and support for mental health and substance use needs. Their practice incorporates evidence-based and integrative approaches tailored to each client’s unique situation, with licensed therapists and professionals focused on comprehensive emotional and behavioral wellness.

They work with individual clients, families, and referring professionals seeking compassionate and personalized therapeutic support to improve mental health, navigate life challenges, and nurture overall well-being. The team emphasizes a holistic, collaborative approach that brings together diverse clinical expertise to create customized care plans and foster healing in a supportive environment.

The goal of this website is to showcase my client Andrea & Associates as a reputable, professional, and effective mental health and therapy provider that a prospective client should work with, and to provide clear CTAs for a prospective client to connect with Andrea & Associates about engaging their counseling, holistic mental health, and therapy services.

### Design

Redesign this landing page to look like it was built by a top-tier modern design agency charging $50k+. Focus on:

- Subtle, sophisticated animations (micro-interactions, smooth transitions)
- A cohesive, premium color palette (avoid anything that feels "template-y")
- Polished details: shadows, gradients, borders that feel intentional and high-end
- Visual rhythm and alignment that feels considered
- Please do animation on every number on each page from 0 and count up when it scrolls into view
- Use refined typography that aligns with the company’s industry and brand identity
- Add a section before the footer that combines the contact details and the message form
- Add a 2026 footer design

The only constraints are to use the attached logo in the navbar, apply fonts suited for a modern layout, follow the original website’s color theme, and ensure any hero stock imagery aligns with their core services or products.

### Copywriting

Take full liberty with the copywriting for this website. In the client's own words, this is how they describe themselves and their services. This information needs to be conveyed in a way that is marketed and comes across well to the user on the website.
